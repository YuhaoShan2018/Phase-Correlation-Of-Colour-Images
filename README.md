# Phase-Correlation-Of-Colour-Images
Moxey 2001 is a script that utlises hypercomplex fourier transforms to calculate relative translative offset between two colour images. NewTechnique.m uses a revised method of Moxey2001, where quarternionic phases are used to locate offset. FileIO.m allows the user to decide which images are used by the previous two scripts.
